get subtitles working
figure out the scrolling

lets get the scrolling through the video to work
then improve everything else
the problem is im not sending to the front end the frontend is just fetching from the
server
is it possible to make it start encoding from a certain time?

since i can encode from any time i would need to
on the front end get total time first then also have a box which can send requests to
the backend and if i send a time which would work it just starts encoding from there
problem= i would need to set the subtitles to that time aswell


-- need to try activly updating the video
-- the html would also need to be adjusted based on time
so lets try just moving the html forward 5 min

so when its full loaded the seek works
ok wtf it just works now,proabbly was only working because it was cached

i still need to do the thing i was talking about before

--subtitles stil 

also at some point make it so that it brings both audio tracks with it
